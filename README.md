This is a minimal Electron React boilerplate code using webpack and webpack-loader. It's simple and you can built upon starter code. I know there are tons of boilerplate code out there but either they are too tricky for beginner or just a pain. I wanted to code my app not stuck in configuring for a year. Feel free to improve by commiting changes
